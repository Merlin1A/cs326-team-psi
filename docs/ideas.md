## Innovative Idea
Course Overflow is designed to be an information repository on courses at
UMass. Users with valid http://umass.edu/ email addresses will be able to create
accounts where they can rate courses, write anonymous course reviews, and view detailed
statistics for each course in the computer science department. The rankings
would be across a couple of dimensions, users could fill in data including
average number of hours spent per week, record their received grades
anonymously, overall difficulty, and more. Users could also write reviews and
upvote/downvote other reviews. There are two similar alternatives, from our
research: Rate my Professor, and CICS course guides. We differ significantly
from Rate my Professor which is just professor specific, only tracks two
metrics, and has no system for statistics, workload, or sorting reviews. For
the CICS course guides, they are generally uninformative, detailed by short
paragraph-sized blurbs which are often years outdated.

## Important Components
The website will have a couple of pages. One for viewing classes, with
different ways of sorting them, i.e. by order in which you have to take them,
by overall rating, by specific ratings, etc. For each course, there will also
be a page full of stats, reviews, and other relevant information for the
course. On each of these pages, there will be a button to have a popup to write
a review and add a datapoint. And on the course reviews, once you have added a
data point, you can write a review and upvote/downvote other reviews. Finally,
there will be a page for creating an account and a login page. We will have
database storing various pieces of information. This database would support
creation through user accounts, data points, and reviews. It would support read
via viewing courses, statistics, etc. It would support updating through
updating upvote counts and overall course statistics with every additional
datapoint. Finally, it would support deletion as once reviews receive a
sufficent number of downvotes they will be deleted. Additionally, users will
have the ability to delete their account.
