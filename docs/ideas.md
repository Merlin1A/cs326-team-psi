## Innovative Idea
Course Overflow is designed to be an information repository on courses at UMass. Users with valid http://umass.edu/ email addresses will be able to create accounts where they can rate courses, write anonymous course reviews, and view detailed statistics for each course in the computer science department. The rankings would be across a couple of dimensions. Users could fill in data, including an average number of hours spent per week, record their received grades anonymously, the overall difficulty, and more. Users could also write reviews and upvote/downvote other reviews. There are two similar alternatives from our research: Rate my Professor and CICS course guides. We differ significantly from Rate my Professor, which is just professor-specific, only tracks two metrics, and has no statistics, workload, or sorting reviews system. The CICS course guides are generally uninformative, detailed by short paragraph-sized blurbs that are often outdated.

## Important Components
The website will have a couple of pages: One for viewing classes, with different sorting methods, i.e., by order in which you have to take them, by overall rating, by specific ratings, etc. There will also be a page full of stats, reviews, and other relevant information for each course. There will be a button to have a popup to write a review and add a data point on each of these pages. And on the course reviews, once you have added a data point, you can write a review and upvote/downvote other reviews. Finally, there will be a page for creating an account and a login page. We will have a database storing various pieces of information. This database would support creation through user accounts, data points, and reviews. It would support reading via viewing courses, statistics, etc. It would support updating through updating upvote counts and overall course statistics with every additional data point. Finally, it would support deletion, as once reviews receive a sufficient number of downvotes, the reviews will be deleted. Additionally, users will have the ability to delete their accounts.
