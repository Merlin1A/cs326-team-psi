# Grading Rubric
This rubric outlines how our website, [***courseoverflow***](https://courseoverflow.herokuapp.com/), satisfies the final project specification.

## Courseoverflow

Courseoverflow is designed to be an information repository on courses computer science courses at UMass Amherst. **Users with valid http://umass.edu/ email addresses** will be able to create accounts where they can rate courses, write anonymous course reviews, and view detailed statistics for each course in the computer science department; the service is only availible for UMass Amherst students. The rankings would be across a couple of dimensions, users could fill in data including average number of hours spent per week, record their received grades anonymously, overall difficulty, and more. Users could also write reviews and upvote/downvote other reviews. There are two similar alternatives, from our research: Rate my Professor, and CICS course guides. We differ significantly from Rate my Professor which is just professor specific, only tracks two metrics, and has no system for statistics, workload, or sorting reviews. For the CICS course guides, we actually scrape them to display on each course course card.
